# Decision-GAME
The program performs a series of operations to search for similarities that are previously registered in the program, with the help of functions. A search of .txt documents is performed to show the user the previously designed history. Each decision taken by the user will show a different value, for this the use of recursion and cycles is essential for its operation.![image](https://github.com/RodEsB/Decision-GAME/assets/107639915/a230ba1b-b8e4-41f2-934c-1e7b0ad8a823)
